# Google-Youtube Python Code-Challenge

Welcome to the YouTube Command-Line Application project! This project is designed to simulate the functionality of YouTube, without the use of any web elements. The aim of this project is to provide users with an opportunity to experience what a software engineer at Google might do on a larger scale. By running this command-line application, you'll be able to simulate how a user would interact with YouTube in real life.

The application implements various components of the YouTube application. These components include features such as searching for videos, viewing videos, and managing playlists. 

The application can be tested by entering various commands and seeing how the application responds.
